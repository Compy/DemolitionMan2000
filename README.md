Demolition Man 2000
===================

About
-------------------
This project is for the Demolition Man Pinball 2000 project. This project aims to port an existing Demolition Man pinball machine to a Pinball 2000 machine by mounting an LCD monitor upside down above the playfield glass. The control system utilizes a P-ROC board from PinballControllers.com to drive the existing WPC driver boards.

Dependencies
-------------------
This project utilizes the Panda3D framework for graphics rendering and multi-process control. Panda3D can be downloaded from <http://www.panda3d.org/>

Python 2.7 is also required

Assets
-------------------
Assets (game sounds, music, etc) are owned by WMS Industries, Planetary Pinball and Warner Bros. As such, I cannot host them here. If you own the game already, assets can be provided legally. Contact me for details.
